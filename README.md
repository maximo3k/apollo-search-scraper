# Apollo.io Search Scraper
This tool helps to scrape and export a search list from Apollo.
Apollo.io gives lots of email credits but limits the export credits a lot.
You can extract the contacts and their emails with this tool.

This works best if you have a paid plan for Apollo.io, otherwise they might only allow you to check up to 5 pages of results.

It exports the contacts into a CSV file:
